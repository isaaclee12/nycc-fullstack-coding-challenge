Prereqs:
1) Have node.js setup on your environment
2) Have python setup on your enviornment

Setup:
1) Create a virtual environment setup(This can be created in any dir, it also doesn't have to be named venv):
  a) run: python3 -m venv venv
2) Activate the virtual enviroment:
  a) run: source [path to virtual enviorment]/bin/activate
  b) You should now see your virual enviroment in parentheses ex: (venv)
3) Install dependencies:
  a) run: pip install -r [path to]requirements.txt
4) Run migrations:
  a) run: python manage.py makemigrations
  b) run: python manage.py migrate
  c) run: python manage.py populate_db
5) Setup the frontend
  a) cd to frontend dir and run: "npm install" or "yarn install"

Running the services:
1) For the backwnd run: python manage.py runserver
2) For the frontend run in the frontend dir: "yarn start" or "npm start"

Use:
You will need a token to access the endpoints. You can get the token by making a post request passing a valid username and password. Then adding it to your "Autherization" header when making api calls for example: "Token [token]"

# New York City Council Full Stack Coding Challenge
## The Task
NYC’s 51 Council Members want a dashboard application that shows the complaints being made in their respective district. The backend will be a Django RESTful API and a React frontend that makes API calls to the backend endpoints.

# What we’re providing
We’ve set up some starter code for you to use. For this challenge you will be working with React as your frontend and Django as your backend API. Here’s what we’ve done to get you set up:
- The default React files generated by the `npx create-react-app` command.
- Django files generated by the `django-admin startproject` command.
- A SQLite3 database that’s already seeded with User data, UserProfile data, and Complaint data.
  - Each login follows this format:
    - Username: {first_name_initial}{last_name}
    - Password: {last_name}-{district_number}
    - (NOTE: Single digit district numbers do not have zero-padding) 
- Empty methods/views and serializers for the endpoints that you will use on the React side.

## Important things to know about the data
1. The fields `account` and `council_dist` both refer to a council district. However, `account` refers to the district in which the complaint is being made, and `council_dist` refers to the district in which the person who is making the complaint lives. *(i.e., John Doe is the Council Member for District 1, if a noise complaint labels ACCOUNT as NYCC01 and COUNCIL_DIST as NYCC34, that means the complaint is being made in his district, but the person who filed the complaint lives in district 34).*
2. All of the data are string data types except for the open and close dates. In addition, the data is **NOT** entirely clean; some fields will be empty strings or NULL.

## How to Start
1. Start by forking our [Github repository](https://github.com/NewYorkCityCouncil/fullstack-coding-challenge) that contains the starter code.
2. Make sure your forked repository is **public** so the team can access and review the code.
3. Make sure you have python **version 3.6 or greater**.
4. Inside the main directory (`fullstack-coding-challenge/testApp`), run the following commands to install your dependencies and set up your database:
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt` (you can do this in a virtual environment like venv or anaconda if you’d like)
  - `python manage.py migrate`
  - `python manage.py populate_db`
  - `python manage.py createsuperuser` (If you want to access the django admin portal to view the data)
5. Inside of the React app (`fullstack-coding-challenge/testApp/frontend`), run `npm install` to get all of your frontend dependencies.
6. From there you should be able to start your frontend and backend using `npm start` and `python manage.py migrate`, respectively.

## MVP
### The Django Side ([Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/))
1. Fill in the empty serializers that will return the database queries in readable JSON format (`fullstack-coding-challenge/testApp/complaint_app/serializers.py`) ([Django REST framework serializer documentation)](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/))
2. Fill in the empty viewsets with database queries that the frontend is requesting (see React MVP #2) (`fullstack-coding-challenge/testApp/complaint_app/views.py`) ([Django REST framework viewset documentation](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/))

### The React Side ([React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html))
1. Create a simple login page for Council members to input their credentials (see above in the ‘What we’re providing’ section for the format)
2. Create simple dashboard page that displays the following information:
  - The number of open cases in their district (has an open date, but no closing date)
  - The number of closed cases in their district
  - The top type of complaint being made in their district
  - Tabular data of all complaints made in their district

## BONUS POINTS
### Django
Create new endpoint and viewset that should return all complaints that were made by constituents that live in the logged in council member’s district. *(i.e., John Doe is the Council Member for District 1, and he clicks on the new button. His dashboard table now only shows complaints where COUNCIL_DIST is NYCC01).*

### React
Create a button labelled “Complaints by My Constituents”. This button will trigger a GET request to a different endpoint than what you’ve been using for the MVP. The data return from this endpoint should replace the data in the table.
